                        <p>We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to
                            change along with the Services. We reserve the right to change the Terms at any
                            point in time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by placing a notice on the

                        <p>Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of

                            of any remaining part of that term, clause or provision, or any other term, clause, or
